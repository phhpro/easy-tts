# PHP Easy TTS

**PHP Easy TTS** is a **free PHP script** adding text-to-speech output to just about any PHP enabled web page with minimal requirements; save for a simple begin and end marker in the form of a vanilla mark-up comment.

The marker can be anywhere, wrapping tags or paragraphs, or right in the middle of a sentence. Multiple markers are not (yet) supported. Any content outside the first marker, including subsequent markers, will not be spoken.

Requires a valid `VoiceRSS` API key. [Registration is free](http://www.voicerss.org/registration.aspx).
